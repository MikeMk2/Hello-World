# Hello-World
For now, just exploring. 

Hi. I'm a newbie web-developer. Web, because it just so happened that languages I used as an entry point into programming belong in this group. Apparently. I'm very interested in learning other languages too, and maybe becoming a full-stack dev one day if everything goes well (or specialize. Whichever way the road will take me). 

"new" doesn't mean "young" in this case. I'm 30 y.o. 

I'll be probably making some websites here for practice. So, if anyone has some helpful comments, and once there is anything to actually comment on, you're welcomed. 

Michael
